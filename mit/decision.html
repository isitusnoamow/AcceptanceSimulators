                    <p>Dear John,</p>

                    <p>On behalf of the Admissions Committee, it is my pleasure to offer you admission to the MIT Class of 20241 You stood out as one of the most talented
                        and promising students in one of the most competitive applicant pools in the history of the Institute. Your commitment to personal excellence and
                        principled goals has convinced us you will both contribute to our diverse community and thrive within our academic environment. We think that you and
                        MIT are a great match.<br><br>
                        You have until May 1 to let us know if you'll call MIT your home for the next four years. Until then, we look forward to helping you get to know us better.
                        While you may have heard that Campus Preview Weekend has been cancelled, we're still working on other ways that you can engage with our
                        community virtually. Over the next several weeks, we'll be in touch with more details.<br><br>
                        MIT's mission is to educate students in science, technology, and other areas of scholarship, to best prepare them to solve the world's greatest
                        challenges. Make no mistake, the rigor here iS real, but so is the excitement of discovery both inside and outside the classroom. The ways that
                        students collaborate and help each other are varied and many.<br><br>
                        hope you'll agree with us that MIT is the perfect place to prepare for your future. As a member of our community, you'll join builders, scholars,
                        entrepreneurs, and humanitarians. Together, you will make a true difference in a world that desperately needs you.<br><br>
                        Many congratulations and welcome to MIT! Now stop reading this and go celebrate!
                    </p>
