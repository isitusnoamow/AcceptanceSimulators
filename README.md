# preparetoberejected
A website with a list of college decision letters to help prepare for the inevitable.

It's March already, and so I thought I should prepare for the inevitable rejection(s). On this website, I've compiled a list of various decision letters -- Rejection letters to prepare yourself when the time comes, Acceptance Letters for the curious majority, and a some Waitlist/Deferral Letters for completeness. Some of the letters come from schools that I've applied to, but the majority comes from various places on the Web. Rejection is just a mindset, don't get too caught up the disappointment.
